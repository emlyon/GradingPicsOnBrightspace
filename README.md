# Grading Brightspace assignments with a desktop app.

###I create this desktop app for the following use case:  
- large number of students in the session (in my session: 500+ students)
- the assignment is submitted on dropbox
- students must upload pictures, and only pictures
- the grading is "pass or fail": I just need to visualize the pic, see if it meets the standards, and grade accordingly.

###Grading from the Brightspace website is too slow because:
- pics take some time to load  
- some pics can be seen directly in preview (jpeg format), but others need to be clicked on to be opened (png format)
This is enough to make grading for a very large number of students, for several assignments, a nightmare.

###Solution:  
- I download all assignments as a zip file
- a desktop app opens the pics one by one, with the name of the student below it, and with 2 buttons: "pass" and "fail".
- clicking on a button writes the grade in an Excel file, and moves to the next picture.
- When done with all the pics, I will just upload the grades of the Excel file on Brightspace.

###Technical aspects of the solution:
- I will take this opportunity to develop a JavaFX app for Windows an Mac.
- I should add a connection to the api of Brightspace to skip the manual download and upload, that's planned.
